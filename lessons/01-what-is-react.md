# Lesson 1: What is React?

## Introduction
React is a **JavaScript library** used to build **interactive user interfaces (UIs)**. It was developed by **Facebook (now Meta)** and is widely used for creating **fast, scalable, and maintainable** web applications.

## Why React?
React is popular because it offers:

✅ **Component-Based Architecture** – Build reusable UI components.


✅ **Virtual DOM** – Optimized rendering for better performance.

✅ **Declarative Syntax** – Describe how the UI should look, and React updates it efficiently.

✅ **Strong Community & Ecosystem** – Backed by Meta and widely adopted in the industry.

## Key Features of React
1️⃣ **Component-Based** – UI is broken into reusable pieces.

2️⃣ **JSX (JavaScript XML)** – A syntax extension to write HTML inside JavaScript.

3️⃣ **State Management** – Manages dynamic data inside components.

4️⃣ **Props (Properties)** – Pass data between components.

5️⃣ **Hooks** – Use state and lifecycle features in functional components.

6️⃣ **React Router** – Enables navigation between pages in a Single Page Application (SPA).

## Understanding Single Page Applications (SPA)
Traditional websites reload the entire page when navigating. **React uses SPA architecture**, where only required parts of the page update dynamically. This results in:

🚀 **Faster Performance** – No full-page reloads.

🎯 **Better User Experience** – Smooth transitions between pages.

### Example: Traditional vs. React SPA
#### **Traditional Website Flow**
```
User clicks a link → Full page reloads → Server sends new HTML → Slower experience
```
#### **React SPA Flow**
```
User clicks a link → Only necessary parts update → No full reload → Faster experience
```

## Real-World Example
React is used by major companies like **Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Airbnb, Uber, and Netflix** to build dynamic web applications.

## Summary
🔹 **React is a JavaScript library for building UIs efficiently.**

🔹 **It follows a component-based architecture.**

🔹 **SPAs improve speed and user experience by preventing full page reloads.**

🔹 **React is widely adopted and has strong community support.**
