# Lesson 3: Props --> Passing Data to Components in React ðŸš€
Props (short for "properties") are one of the most important features in React, allowing you to pass data between components. In this lesson, we will explore how to use props to make your components dynamic and reusable. You'll learn how to pass data from a parent component to a child component and use that data in the child component.
